<b> Summary </b>

During a paired programming challenge, me and my partner built a drawing app using HTML canvas, JS, and Socket IO. This is a fun app 
that you can collaborate with your friends on and create a masterpiece. I really enjoyed building a resource to help bring creative minds
together. This app was also a very fun project to learn how to use Socket IO.

<b> Challenges </b>
One of the biggest challenges we faced in the project was getting the color picker to work properly. The color picker was putting out 
color in rgb format with a lot of decimals, and we had to convert it to HEX color. 

Another challenge that we faced was getting the brush on the screen to become a smooth solid line. To render the paint brush
we had to create ellipses, and then connect the ellipses with a line.
